# TastyBites App - Planning Document

## Project Vision
TastyBites is a recipe finder application that allows users to discover new recipes based on ingredients or keywords. The application focuses on providing a seamless, user-friendly experience with an aesthetically pleasing interface that works well across all devices.

## Core Features
1. **Recipe Search** - Users can search for recipes by ingredients or keywords
2. **Results Display** - Present search results in an organized, visually appealing list
3. **Recipe Details** - Provide detailed view of selected recipes including ingredients, instructions, and preparation time
4. **Favorites System** - Allow users to save and access their favorite recipes
5. **Responsive Design** - Ensure optimal experience across all device sizes

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using NextJs as the build tool
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state, with local component state where appropriate
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation between pages
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for API requests with caching
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication
- **UI Component Library**: shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 and tw animations with custom theme (green/orange color scheme)
- **Storage**: Browser's localStorage for persisting user favorites

### API Integration
- **API Source**: TheMealDB (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - Search by name: `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s={query}`
  - Search by ingredient: `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i={ingredient}`
  - Get recipe by ID: `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i={id}`
  - List all categories: `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php`
  - Lookup single random meal: `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php`

## Design Specifications

### Theme Configuration
- Create a custom theme in `tailwind.config.ts` with:
  - Primary color: green (for branding, primary buttons)
  - Secondary color: orange (for accents, highlights)
  - Neutral colors for text and backgrounds

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 639px
- Tablet: 640px - 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px and above

### Design Principles
- Clean, uncluttered layouts
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Accessible color contrasts and font sizes
- Intuitive navigation and search functionality
- Consistent spacing and component sizing

## Development Workflow
1. Set up project with Vite, React, TypeScript
2. Configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
3. Implement core application structure and routing
4. Create API services using Axios and TanStack Query
5. Develop UI components based on design specifications
6. Implement search functionality and results display
7. Add recipe details page
8. Implement favorites functionality with localStorage
9. Add error handling and loading states
10. Test across devices for responsiveness
11. Optimize performance and accessibility

## Technical Constraints
- API rate limits from TheMealDB
- Browser storage limitations for favorites
- Cross-browser compatibility requirements

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize image loading for recipe thumbnails
- Implement proper caching with TanStack Query
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Implement search debouncing to minimize API calls

## Testing Strategy
- Component testing with Vitest
- User interaction testing with React Testing Library
- Responsive design testing across various device sizes
- Accessibility testing with axe-core

## Deployment
- Build optimized production bundle with Vite
- Host on a static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify)

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- User accounts for cloud-synced favorites
- Meal planning and shopping list features
- Recipe filtering by dietary restrictions
- Social sharing functionality
- Dark/light theme toggle
